Hi! I'm Jesai, and I develop and maintain Writing Tools (Windows & Linux) with help from our amazing contributors.

Writing Tools will always remain completely free and open-source.

If you find value in it, it would mean the world to me if you could support my continued development of it ‚ù§Ô∏è

## ‚ú® What is Writing Tools?

Writing Tools is an **Apple Intelligence-inspired application for Windows, Linux, and macOS that supercharges your writing with an AI LLM** (cloud-based or local).

With one hotkey press system-wide, it lets you fix grammar, optimize text according to your instructions, summarize content (webpages, YouTube videos, etc.), and more.

It's currently the **world's most intelligent system-wide grammar assistant** and works in almost any language!

## ‚ö° What can I do with it, exactly?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hyper-intelligent Writing Tools:
- Select _any_ text on your PC and invoke Writing Tools with `ctrl+space`.
- Choose **Proofread**, **Rewrite**, **Friendly**, **Professional**, **Concise**, or even enter **custom instructions** (e.g., _"add comments to this code"_, _"make it title case"_, _"translate to French"_).
- Your text will instantly be replaced with the AI-optimized version. Use `ctrl+z` to revert.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Powerful content summarization that you can chat with:
- Select all text in any webpage, document, email, etc., with `ctrl+a`, or select the transcript of a YouTube video (from its description).
- Choose **Summary**, **Key Points**, or **Table** after invoking Writing Tools.
- Get a pop-up summary with clear and beautiful formatting (with Markdown rendering), saving you hours.
- Chat with the summary if you'd like to learn more or have questions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Chat with an LLM anytime in a click:
- Press `ctrl+space` without selecting text to start a conversation with your LLM _(for privacy, chat history is deleted when you close the window)_.

## üåü Why Choose Writing Tools?

Aside from being the only Windows/Linux program like Apple's Writing Tools, and the only way to use them on an Intel Mac:

- **More intelligent than Apple's Writing Tools and Grammarly Premium:** Apple uses a tiny 3B parameter model, while Writing Tools lets you use much more advanced models for free (e.g., Gemini 2.0 Flash [~30B]). Grammarly's rule-based NLP can't compete with LLMs.
- **Completely free and open-source:** No subscriptions or hidden costs. Bloat-free and uses **0% of your CPU** when idle.
- **Versatile AI LLM support:** Jump in quickly with the **free Gemini API & Gemini 2.0**, or an extensive range of **local LLMs** (via Ollama [[instructions]](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools?tab=readme-ov-file#-optional-ollama-local-llm-instructions), llama.cpp, KoboldCPP, TabbyAPI, vLLM, etc.) or **cloud-based LLMs** (ChatGPT, Mistral AI, etc.) through Writing Tools' OpenAI-API-compatibility.
- **Does not mess with your clipboard, and works system-wide.**
- **Privacy-focused**: Your API key and config files stay on *your* device. NO logging, diagnostic collection, tracking, or ads. Invoked *only* on your command. Local LLMs keep your data on your device & work without the internet.
- **Supports multiple languages:** Works with any language and translates text better than Google Translate (type "translate to [language]" in `Describe your change...`).
- **Code support:** Fix, improve, translate, or add comments to code with `Describe your change...`."
- **Themes, Dark Mode, & Customization**: Choose between **2 themes**: a blurry gradient theme and a plain theme that resembles the Windows + V pop-up! Also has full **dark mode** support. **Set your own hotkey** for quick access.

Writing Tools has been featured on [Beebom](https://beebom.com/high-schooler-app-brings-apple-inteligence-writing-tools-windows/), [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-pc-can-now-deliver-instant-free-writing-help-across-all-apps/), [Neowin](https://www.neowin.net/news/this-small-app-brings-some-apple-intelligence-features-to-windows/), [and](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/can-apple-catch-up-apple-intelligence-just-shipped-yet-free-apple-writing-tools-on-github-for-windows-and-linux-make-a-better-alternative) [numerous](https://tinhte.vn/thread/mang-apple-intelligence-len-windows-chay-gemini-1-5-flash-thong-minh-hon-ho-tro-san-tieng-viet.3840902/) [others](https://www.computer-wd.com/2024/10/new-computer-programs-to-try-now.html)!

## ‚úÖ Installation

### Windows:
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/releases) page and download the latest `Writing.Tools.zip` file.
2. Extract it to your desired location, run `Writing Tools.exe`, and enjoy! :D

*Note: Writing Tools is a portable app. If you extract it into a protected folder (e.g., Program Files), run it as administrator at least on first launch so it can create/edit its config file (in the same folder as its exe).*

**PS:** Go to Writing Tools' Settings (from its tray icon at the bottom right of the taskbar) to enable starting Writing Tools on boot.

### Linux:
Run it from the source code (instructions below).

### macOS (beta):
The macOS version is a **native Swift port**, developed by [Aryamirsepasi](https://github.com/Aryamirsepasi). View the [README inside the macOS folder](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/tree/main/macOS) to learn more.

To install it:
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools/releases) page and download the latest `.dmg` file.
2. Open the `.dmg` file, also open a Finder Window, and drag the `writing-tools.app` into the Applications folder. That's it!

## üëÄ Tips

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Summarise a YouTube video from its transcript:

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make Writing Tools work better in MS Word: the `ctrl+space` keyboard shortcut is mapped to "Clear Formatting", making you lose paragraph indentation. Here's how to improve this:
P.S.: Word's rich-text formatting (bold, italics, underline, colours...) will be lost on using Writing Tools. A Markdown editor such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has no such issue.

## ‚ú® Options Explained

- **Proofread:** The smartest grammar & spelling corrector. Sorry not sorry, Grammarly Premium.
- **Rewrite:** Improve the phrasing of your text.
- **Make Friendly/Professional:** Adjust the tone of your text.
- **Custom Instructions:** Tailor your request (e.g., "Translate to French") through `Describe your change...`.

The following options respond in a pop-up window (with markdown rendering, selectable text, and a zoom level that saves & applies on app restarts):
- **Summarize:** Create clear and concise summaries.
- **Extract Key Points:** Highlight the most important points.
- **Create Tables:** Convert text into a formatted table. PS: You can copy & paste the table into MS Word.

## üîí Privacy

I believe strongly in protecting your privacy. Writing Tools:
- Does not collect or store any of your writing data by itself. It doesn't even collect general logs, so it's super light and privacy-friendly.
- Lets you use local LLMs to process your text entirely on-device.
- Only sends text to the chosen AI provider (encrypted) when you *explicitly* use one of the options.
- Only stores your API key locally on your device.

Note: If you choose to use a cloud based LLM, refer to the AI provider's privacy policy and terms of service.

## ü¶ô (Optional) Ollama Local LLM Instructions:
1. [Download](https://ollama.com/download) and install Ollama.
2. Choose an LLM from [here](https://ollama.com/library). Recommended: Llama 3.1 8B (~8GB RAM or VRAM required).
3. Run `ollama run llama3.1:8b` in your terminal to download and launch Llama 3.1.
4. In Writing Tools, set the `OpenAI-Compatible` provider with:
   - API Key: `ollama`
   - API Base URL: `http://localhost:11434/v1`
   - API Model: `llama3.1:8b`
5. That's it! Enjoy Writing Tools with _absolute_ privacy and no internet connection! üéâ From now on, you'll simply need to launch Ollama and Writing Tools into the background for it to work.

## üêû Known Issues
1. (Being investigated) On some devices, Writing Tools does not work correctly with the default hotkey.
   
   To fix it, simply change the hotkey to **ctrl+`** or **ctrl+j** and restart Writing Tools. PS: If a hotkey is already in use by a program or background process, Writing Tools may not be able to intercept it. The above hotkeys are usually unused.

2. The initial launch of the `Writing Tools.exe` might take unusually long ‚Äî this seems to be because AV software extensively scans this new executable before letting it run. Once it launches into the background in RAM, it works instantly as usual.

## üë®‚Äçüíª To Run Writing Tools Directly from the Source Code

If you prefer to run the program directly from the `main.py` file, follow these OS-specific instructions.

**1. Download the Code**
- Click the green `<> Code ‚ñº` button toward the very top of this page, and click `Download ZIP`.

**2. Install Dependencies**  
After extracting the folder, open your **Terminal** (or **Command Prompt**) in the relevant directory.

- Windows:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\Windows_and_Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- Linux:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Windows_and_Linux
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
Of course, you'll need to have [Python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)!

**3. Run the Program**
- **Windows:**
   ```bash
   pythonw main.py
   ```
- **Linux:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## üë®‚Äçüíª To compile the application yourself:

### Windows and Linux Version build instructions:
Here's how to compile it with PyInstaller and a virtual environment:

1. First, create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# Install virtualenv if you haven't already
pip install virtualenv

# Create a new virtual environment
# If you use Pyhton 3.3+ then use: python -m venv myvenv
virtualenv myvenv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
myvenv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux:
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

2. Once activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Build Writing Tools:
```bash
python pyinstaller-build-script.py
```

### macOS Version (by [Aryamirsepasi](https://github.com/Aryamirsepasi)) build instructions:

1. **Install Xcode**
   - Download and install Xcode from the App Store
   - Launch Xcode once installed and complete any additional component installations

2. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open Terminal and navigate to a directory you want the project to be in:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theJayTea/WritingTools.git
   cd WritingTools
   ```

3. **Create Xcode Project**
   - Navigate to the project's macOS directory:
     ```bash
     cd macOS
     ```
   - Create a new Xcode project:
     ```bash
     xcodebuild -project writing-tools.xcodeproj
     ```

4. **Open in Xcode**
   - Double-click the generated `writing-tools.xcodeproj` file

     swift package resolve
     ```

7. **Build and Run**
   - In Xcode, select "My Mac" as the run destination
   - Click the Play button or press ‚åòR to build and run

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the "Could not open file" error:
1. Ensure you're opening the `.xcodeproj` file, not the folder
2. If the error persists, try:
   ```bash
   cd WritingTools/macOS
   rm -rf writing-tools.xcodeproj
   xcodebuild -project writing-tools.xcodeproj
   ```
